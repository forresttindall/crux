## Origin Story

While border-hopping in Mexico, a sketchy encounter sparked the idea: A self-defense multi-tool that would would not mind if you needed to abandon at a border crossing.

That’s how **Crux** was born — a minimalist, carry-friendly multitool that doubles as a discreet self-defense device. Lightweight, pocketable, and designed to give you options if things go sideways.
