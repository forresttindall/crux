## Origin Story

While border-hopping in Mexico, a sketchy encounter sparked the idea: What if one tool could get you out of a jam, both mechanical and personal?

That’s how **Crux** was born — a minimalist, carry-friendly multitool that doubles as a discreet self-defense device. Lightweight, pocketable, and designed to give you options when things go sideways.
